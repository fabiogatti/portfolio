# Welcome to my portfolio project!

In this section you will learn a couple of things about the project. The installation steps and commands will be at the end of this file.

## Project

One of the main libraries used in this project was animejs for almost all of the big impact animations. I also added in the middle of the project development sass (for a specific need inside the portfolio page). Also used fontawesome for the icons and some custom svg files and favicon.

The page is divided in 4 main components (Not including the main #App component); about me, skills, portfolio and contact.
I tried my best to make them all look good in any device and with most resolutions. When the ascpect ratio of the page changes below 8/5 the page will hide the sidebar and load a mobile navbar so the user can navigate more comfortably. The skills page will also change to match the new window width.

There are a couple of components that got hover interactions in the page that you can miss if you dont search for them. You can also click the title of the sections to change the color of it if you dont like it!

That pretty much sums it, i will revisit the project in the future to change some stuff related to the background and mainly to add the portfolio once i got enough decent organized projects done.

Have fun and hope you like it!
